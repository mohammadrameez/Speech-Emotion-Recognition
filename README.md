# Speech-Emotion-Recognition

Speech emotion recognition is the process of deciphering emotional states or sentiments from speech signals. Librosa, a popular Python library, is typically employed for audio analysis and extracting features from audio signals. Although Librosa primarily concentrates on music analysis, it can be adapted to address certain aspects of speech emotion recognition as well.

**Let's explore the process of Speech Emotion Recognition using Librosa :**

# Data Collection and Preprocessing:
  + We begin by collecting speech samples labeled with emotions. The audio data undergoes preprocessing, including consistent sampling rates, noise removal, and segmentation into smaller frames (usually around 20-30 ms each).

# Feature Extraction:
  + Librosa can be used to extract various audio features from these segmented frames. Some commonly used features for emotion recognition include:

# Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs)

  + Spectral contrast
  + Chroma feature
  + Energy
  + Zero-crossing rate
  + Pitch-related features

# Feature Normalization:
  + Make sure to standardize the extracted features, ensuring they share similar scales. This step is crucial as it significantly boosts the performance of machine learning models.

# Machine Learning Models:
  + Train machine learning models using the features you've extracted and standardized. You have the flexibility to choose from different algorithms such as Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forests, or neural networks.

# Model Evaluation:
  + Divide your dataset into two parts: one for training and the other for testing. Teach your selected model using the training data and assess how well it performs on the test set. Utilize suitable evaluation metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to         gauge its effectiveness.

# Fine-Tuning and Optimization:
  + Try out various combinations of features, different types of models, and tweak the model settings to enhance its performance. Experimenting with elements like cross-validation can provide insights into how well your model can adapt to new data.

# Deployment:
  + After achieving a satisfying model, you're ready to deploy it for predicting emotions in new, unheard speech samples.
